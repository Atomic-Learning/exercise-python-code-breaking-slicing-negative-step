<p>Explore how negative steps work in slicing, opening up new ways to manipulate strings.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Understanding Negative Steps</h2>

A string is defined in the code cell below. Use slicing with negative steps to get the following parts of the string:
<ul>
<li>The whole string, reversed</li>
<li>The last five characters, reversed</li>
<li>Every 2nd character forward</li>
<li>Every 2nd character reversed</li>
</ul>


<py-cell>
code_string = "q!2refrdgho2!c73 h#eg4hfet@f gvdd4e kkfgc1dab,r3fcgh fguthofeYe"
# Try the slicing operations here and print the results
</py-cell>

<h2>Part 2: Solve the Puzzle</h2>

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Extract every third character counting backward from the penultimate character. This should reveal a hidden message!</p>

<py-cell>
# Write your code here to extract the hidden message using negative indices and a negative step
